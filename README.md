# EZ-2D-VoxelEngine (Unity)

EZ-2D-VoxelEngine is a modular and performance-focused 2D voxel engine built in Unity.
It is designed to create large sandbox worlds similar to games like Terraria or Starbound,
while remaining easy to extend and understand for developers.

This repository contains the full Unity project as well as the complete source code
for learning, experimenting, and building your own voxel-based games.

## Features

- Chunk-based world system for very large or infinite worlds
- Procedural world generation
- Fluid simulation system
- Dynamic lighting system
- High performance and optimized core systems
- Modular architecture for easy expansion
- Designed for 2D sandbox and voxel-style games

## Engine Philosophy

The goal of EZ-2D-VoxelEngine is to provide a solid and efficient core that developers
can build upon. Core systems such as world generation, chunks, lighting, and fluids
are implemented in a way that prioritizes performance and stability.

The engine is intended to be extended with custom gameplay systems, mechanics,
and content without requiring changes to the core architecture.

## Project Structure

The engine is provided as a Unity project and can be added to existing projects.

The core systems are structured and separated to make them easy to read,
modify, and extend.

Developers can:
- Study how the engine works internally
- Use it as a foundation for their own games
- Extend or replace systems as needed

## Getting Started

### Adding the Engine to Your Unity Project

1. Download the `.unityproject` file from this repository
2. Open your Unity project
3. Drag and drop the `.unityproject` file directly into your Unity project folder
4. Unity will automatically import the engine and its assets

After importing, you can open the example scene to see the engine in action.

## Use Cases

- Terraria-style sandbox games
- 2D voxel-based survival or building games
- Procedural world experiments
- Learning resource for chunk systems, fluids, and lighting in Unity

## Version

Current version: 1.0a  
This version represents the first public release of the engine.

## License
